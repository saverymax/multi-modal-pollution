# Introduction

This is the documentation for data and code used in the Master thesis of Max Savery, titled "Forecasting Air Pollution During the COVID-19 Lockdowns in Belgium".

In this documentation, we discuss the following topics:
1. What data we used, where to get the data, and how to process the data   
2. The models we used and how you can run the models   
3. The experiments we conducted and how to run the results  

Relevant links are provided, particularly regarding the location of the data and the code to run the models.
